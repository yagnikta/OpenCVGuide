dst(x, y) = src1(x, y) - src2(x, y)
But with saturation arithmetic â€” meaning no negative values allowed.
If a subtraction results in a negative value, OpenCV clips it to 0 instead of allowing wrap-around.


Use Case	            Description
Motion detection	    Subtract background frame from current frame to detect movement.
Image differencing	    Highlight differences between two similar images.
Masking	Subtract        mask regions to isolate foreground.
Edge sharpening	        Combine with filters to boost details by subtracting blurred version.
