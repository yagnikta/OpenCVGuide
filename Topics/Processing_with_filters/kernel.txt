* What is the Kernel in context to OpenCV?

- A kernel is a small matrix (2D array) used to apply operations like Blurring, Sharpening, Edge detection, Embossing, etc.
- It's also sometimes called a filter or convolution matrix.
- A kernel (filter) is slid over the image pixel by pixel, and at each location, a dot product between the kernel and the image region is computed. That result becomes a pixel in the output image.

* How is it processed?

- You slide the kernel over the image.
- At each location, you do some math (usually multiply and sum).
- The result becomes a pixel in a new, processed image.
