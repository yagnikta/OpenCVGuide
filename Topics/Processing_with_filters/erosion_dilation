* Basics of Erosion:

- Erodes away the boundaries of the foreground object
- Used to diminish the features of an image.
- Working of erosion:

- A kernel(a matrix of odd size(3,5,7) is convolved with the image.
- A pixel in the original image (either 1 or 0) will be considered 1 only if all the pixels under the kernel are 1, otherwise, it is eroded (made to zero).
- Thus all the pixels near the boundary will be discarded depending upon the size of the kernel.
- So the thickness or size of the foreground object decreases or simply the white region decreases in the image.

* Basics of dilation:

- Increases the object area
- Used to accentuate features
- Working of dilation:

- A kernel(a matrix of odd size(3,5,7) is convolved with the image
- A pixel element in the original image is ‘1’ if at least one pixel under the kernel is ‘1’.
- It increases the white region in the image or the size of the foreground object increases
